This assignment is based on the code of assignment 1

a)

   - 
   

## Part 2:

We had to take following changes to the source code, in order for the tests to pass:

1) GameBoard.java

    - In the JavaDoc of the GameBoard constructor, we had to change the @param parameter from BOARD to OTHER.
    
    - In the mark() method, the return statement had to be changed from TRUE to FALSE, if the board square was already occupied and from FALSE to TRUE if not already occupied.
    
    - In the getOpenPositions() method, the column started iterating at the index of 1 instead at the index of 0. So we changed that.
    
2) TicTacToeGameState.java

    - In the getCurrentPlayer() method, the function should return the currentPlayer and not a random player. Therefore, we commented out the short code which generated a random player.

    - In the hasWin() method, we have changed the return value from FALSE to TRUE
