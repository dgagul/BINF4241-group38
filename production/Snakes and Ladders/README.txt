Important Rules added by us:
- It is not possible for 2 players to be on the same square (expect for the first square).
If a player moves to an already occupied square, he will be sent back to the start.
- Snakes and Ladders are placed every 5 squares and only between the 4th and the 4th-to-last square.

Additional comment:
As opposed to the output example provided, we print the state after player i has moved in the same line as the
result from the die rolled by player i (instead of on the next line after player i+1 has rolled the die).
