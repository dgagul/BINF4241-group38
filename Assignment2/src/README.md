Input specification

- Standard moves should follow the algebraic notation (including disambiguating moves, short notation for pawn moves and En passant without the prefix "e.p.").
- Captures should be denoted with a 'x'.
- In pawn promotion, the piece promoted to should be denoted at the end of the pawn move (for example e8Q means that the pawn moving to e8 shall be promoted to a queen).
- Castling should be denoted as 0-0 for kingside castling and as 0-0-0 for queenside castling.
- A move that places the opponent's king in check does not have to be denoted with the symbol "+" appended. The game automatically checks for check and informs the players accordingly.
